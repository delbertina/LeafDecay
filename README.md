Semester project for Advanced Java class.
Homework for that class was insane so this was pretty much done within a week.
Initially, there are many things that were just duct taped instead of done right.
The plan is to keep improving this, so we'll see how that goes.

How To Use:

Step 1 - Download files
Step 2 - Compile
Step 3 - Place a .txt log file in with the other files
Step 4 - Run the compiled java files
Step 5 - Look at pretty colors
